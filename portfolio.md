# Data Analysis & Visualization

## Change in commute patterns in Texas

I wanted to track how the state of Texas has been doing on returning to "normal" following the COVID-19 pandemic. [Google's Mobility data](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) tracks the % change (relative to February 2020) to how often their users are going to residential areas, parks, grocery stores, and others. I was particularly interested in the "workplaces" category which should be a good indicator of how many workers are returning to office. 

The return to the office hasn't been even. The cities and the Permian Basin are lagging behind the more rural areas of the state.

## COVID-19 Mobility Impacts Dashboard

Starting in April 2020, [I created a blogpost](https://modalshift.co/COVID19/) tracking the changes to Austin's mobility caused by COVID-19. Using data sourced from the City's open data portal, I created some live-updating charts showing vehicle volume, micromobility trips, and traffic incidents. About every month I create a full report showing trends in the data along with a few takeways of mine. Check out my archive of my thoughts & takeaways, too.
