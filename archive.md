### April 29th thoughts & takeways:
* Austin has seen about a 50% in traffic volumes and 10% increase in speeds since the beginning of the lockdown. It's hard to see if the speed data is at all interesting as the data is collected at signalized intersections. Some increased speeds may be caused by speeding drivers, but it also may be caused by decreased congestion. Something to look into later.

* Lyft scooters has decided to pull out of Austin permanently. The amount of shared mircomobility trips that we saw before COVID-19 may not return, ever. Many other providers were in shaky finaincal situations before the current crisis. 

* Traffic incident reports are down, but are fatalities or serious injuries down as well? Who knows for now, as the data takes a long time to collect and to be reported. However, higher speed vehicles and more pedestrians & cyclists is generally a bad combination.
