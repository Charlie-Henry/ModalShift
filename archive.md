### May 1st thoughts & takeways:

* The Governor's order to open restaurants and other businesses begins today. Yesterday's volume data was pretty much on par for what we saw last Thursday. Fridays are usually the highest volume day, since daily rush hour traffic combines with people traveling to locations for the weekend or other leisure activities. We'll see how this looks in the data tomorrow morning. I'll be watching the late evening (6-9pm) to see if we're getting higher volumes of people heading out to eat or whatever. 

* The Austin airport reported a [52% decrease](http://austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/images/Airport/news_releases/activity_report_year/2020/March_2020.pdf) in passenger traffic in March 2020 as compared to March 2019. KLM permanently canceled its new route of Amsterdam-Austin that was scheduled to launch this coming Monday. March 2020 was the least amount of passenger traffic for any 1-month period since February 2014.

### April 29th thoughts & takeways:

* Austin has seen about a 50% in traffic volumes and 10% increase in speeds since the beginning of the lockdown. It's hard to see if the speed data is at all interesting as the data is collected at signalized intersections. Some increased speeds may be caused by speeding drivers, but it also may be caused by decreased congestion. Something to look into later.

* Lyft scooters has decided to pull out of Austin permanently. The amount of shared mircomobility trips that we saw before COVID-19 may not return, ever. Many other providers were in shaky finaincal situations before the current crisis. 

* Traffic incident reports are down, but are fatalities or serious injuries down as well? Who knows for now, as the data takes a long time to collect and to be reported. However, higher speed vehicles and more pedestrians & cyclists is generally a bad combination.
