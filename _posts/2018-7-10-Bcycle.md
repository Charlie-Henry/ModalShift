title: Austin BCycle Free Student Membership
---
Ausitn BCycle, a docked bicycle renting program, expanded in early 2018. The new 9 kiosk locations combined with a new free membership for UT Austin students is changing how students get to class from West Campus. 

## Network Expansion
Austin BCycle opened in 2013 with an initial rollout of stations accross the downtown area. In 2014, BCycle broke bikeshare records for the most amount of bike checkouts in a single day during SXSW. The placement of the checkout kiosks were focused at large tourist destinations such as the convention center, South Congress, Rainey Street, and Barton Springs. From February 15 to May 31 2017, 49% of ridership was for walk-up rentals and 23% was a yearly pass which currently valued at $80.

In February 2018, BCycle opened 9 new stations around and on the UT campus. Previously, there were only 2 kiosks near the campus along The Drag. BCycle also announced the release of a free UT student membership, which allowed students to check out bikes for free up to an hour. 

College students love free stuff. 

One of the questions I had was, how has the BCycle student membership changed transit across Austin? Where more students cycling to Sixth Street on Thursday nights for free, were they opting to hop in an Uber, or hitch a ride on the frequent and free E-Bus?

Some of the most popular routes in 2017 were focused to tourist areas, such as routes between Sixith Street and Rainey Street. Ridership was also strong in areas of low-stress bicycle facilities such as the lake hike & bike trail and the Pfluger pedestrian bridge.

The 2018 expansion showed that all of the new stations are being well used in the campus area. However, only 2 routes from the campus area to the downtown recieved over 100 trips, both originating from the Jester Dormitory BCycle kiosk. Also, some routes in the Downtown area have reduced their frequency, prehaps due to the rise of new dockless vehicles. The expansion may have also reduced the number of bicycles available in downtown, as bikes are checked out and returned to the campus area due to the influx of new riders.

This expansion allowed many students to access free and quick transit across the relatively bike friendly West Campus and Campus areas. The new protected bikeway along Rio Grande Street is now much more utilized with 4 BCycle stations within a block of it. The BCycle expansion, along with the rise of TNCs and other dockless vehciles, has had a definite change to the mode share in the campus community in a short period of time. The Jester doritory station, located at 21st st. and Speedway acts as a hub for the BCycles as many trips start and end there. This is a sign that many students use BCycle as transportation to class, either *to* campus from off campus or from housing *on* campus to other campus destinations.
