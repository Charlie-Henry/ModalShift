title: Scooters: Where to Prioritize Improvements

Where should we implement changes to reduce dockless vehicle parking problems?

[A few weeks ago the City of Austin published the live-updating dockless mobility trip dataset.](https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Dockless-Vehicle-Trips/7d8e-dm7r) The data goes back to April 2018. Below is a map of the count of combined trip origins and destinations of minimum 20k trips.

Regardless of a scooter trip beginning or ending, a scooter will need to be parked somewhere. This has created some problems around Austin including blocked sidewalks, ramps, and stairs. UT Austin is now impounding and issuing fines for improperly parked scooters. Many have blamed riders or vandals for improperly parked scooters, but few blame our lack of sufficient sidewalk space. 

Throughout the Campus area, many newly improved sidewalks are well used as scooter and bike parking. However especially on campus, sidewalks are older and can be blocked by only one improperly parked scooter.

Historically, the City of Austin has had serious problems maintaining sidewalks and expanding the network. The city should divert scooter licensing funds to help pay for these improvements. UT should use funds from parking fines to create more designated parking spaces and improve sidewalks.
