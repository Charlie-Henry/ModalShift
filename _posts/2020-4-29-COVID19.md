### April 16th, 2021 thoughts & takeaways:

* During March, the Governor rescinded all COVID restrictions for the state. The City of Austin still has a mask mandate in place, for now. The relaxing of restrictions, along with the roll out of the vaccine have combined to increase traffic volumes to above 80% of normal traffic conditions. Some days have been closer to 90% of typical traffic, especially on weekends and on Fridays.

* Both TSA checkpoint passengers and micromobility trips saw a big spike during spring break. 

* The Google Mobility data shows "residential" trips are at low point since this time last year. This means more trips people are taking are less "home-based" than they were during the height of the lockdowns.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
