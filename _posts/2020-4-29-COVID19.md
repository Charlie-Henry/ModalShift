title: Measuring COVID-19
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

A post dedicated to measuring the impact ~~and recovery~~ of COVID-19 in the Austin area. 

<!--more-->

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: September 1st**

***

### September 1st thoughts & takeaways:

* Traffic volumes ticked up again last week. I won't expect this to change that much until Austin schools are back in session.

* I've updated the TSA checkpoint data with some of the latest numbers. I find it interesting we dropped below our typical 1% share of USA passengers since the spike in cases in late June. This data is an absolute nightmare to work with (hundreds of PDF pages).

* Micromobility trips have shot up this month. It seems to be in line with students being back in session at UT. Many leases in West Campus start August 1st so that's probably why we see a big tick up around then. Lime has also been giving out $10 in free rides to students last week.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
