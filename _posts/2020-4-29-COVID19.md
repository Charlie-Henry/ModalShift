excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

A post dedicated to measuring the impact ~~and recovery~~ of COVID-19 in the Austin area. 

<!--more-->

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: July 11th**

***

### July 11th thoughts & takeaways:

* Not a whole lot changed over the past week, same trends that we've been seeing since the spike in cases began a few weeks ago. US mobility trends from Apple is also seeing a decrease.

* I've added a new section based on some positive feedback I've been receiving on the Google post-covid trip reports. That will be updated monthly, for now.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
