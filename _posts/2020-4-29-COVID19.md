title: Measuring COVID-19
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

A post dedicated to measuring the impact ~~and recovery~~ of COVID-19 in the Austin area. 

<!--more-->

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: August 14th**

***
### August 14th thoughts & takeaways:

* Traffic volumes fell over the past couple of weeks, speeds are up sharply this week. Will have to look into this further to see if there were some changes at our study intersections.

* As for those study intersections, I've [finally included a map of the intersections](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1zGywOn2kiuE8hZK5PRbp72AStodktfoR&usp=sharing) the traffic volumes come from. 

* At the bottom I've included a graphic that I made that summarizes most of the datasets from February to July.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
