excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

A post dedicated to measuring the impact ~~and recovery~~ of COVID-19 in the Austin area. 

<!--more-->

I will update these charts periodically with new data.

### July 12th, 2021 thoughts & takeaways:

* June airport passenger traffic was 99% of "normal", as compared to February 2020. I'd expect the 4th of July weekend to be a big spike in the data.

* Daily traffic volumes ticked up by about 5% in June to about 90% of normal traffic conditions. 

* As theorized, the spike in incidents in May was likely caused by the rainy weather. The daily rate has fallen down to about 125 incidents per day. 

* The Google mobility data is something I have been watching closely over the past couple weeks. Travel to workplaces is still only about 65% of pre-covid numbers. Travel to Transit Stations has actually surpassed the workplaces category and is 70% of pre-covid.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
