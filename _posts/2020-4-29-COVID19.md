title: Measuring COVID-19
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

A post dedicated to measuring the impact ~~and recovery~~ of COVID-19 in the Austin area. 

<!--more-->

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: August 26th**

***

### August 26th thoughts & takeaways:

* Last week, traffic volumes ticked up 3.2%. However, over the past two months we've been pretty flat. We have yet to break the daily record set back on June 12th. 

* I've removed the Apple/Austin data comparison figure because I think the data is pretty biased and not very useful. 

* I've changed the volume forecast model to take into account the COVID-19 cases, rather than deaths. This data is from COVIDhub and is an ensemble model. To remove day-of-week affects, I've also decided to go with an average daily traffic per week analysis. 

* I've also included Google search trends data as well as Google mobility data. This allows for a scenario forecast where if we decided to end the lockdown completely we'd see a jump in traffic volumes (but not completely back to February levels), or vice versa where we'd go back to a March-level lockdown.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
