A post dedicated to measuring the impact and recovery of COVID-19 in the Austin area.

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: May 18th**

***

### May 18th thoughts & takeways:

* Friday night/Saturday morning's inclement weather caused the highest number of reported traffic incidents since the beginning of the lockdown. 

* The two rainstorms had a pretty major affect on the moving average, causing some data issues at some locations as I mentioned in the last update. As comparing to two weeks ago, only Tuesday and Saturday saw much less volume (-6%, and -2% respectively). I'd expect to see this downward curve start to rebound starting today as the forecast for this week is much better and with the 3-day weekend coming up.
