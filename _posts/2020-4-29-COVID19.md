A post dedicated to measuring the impact ~~and recovery~~ of COVID-19 in the Austin area. 

<!--more-->

I will update these charts periodically with new data.

### June 2nd, 2021 thoughts & takeaways:

* Traffic volumes did moderately tick up over May to about 85% of February 2020 conditions.

* I wrote separate post theorizing, [Did COVID Fix Austin's Traffic Forever?](http://modalshift.co/TrafficFuture/)

* [The uptick in traffic incidents is likely caused by the 4th wettest May on record.](https://www.kxan.com/weather/weather-blog/may-brings-above-normal-rainfall-to-central-texas/)

* The airport appears to be poised to be very close to normal after the next update in passenger numbers.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
