A post dedicated to measuring the impact and recovery of COVID-19 in the Austin area.

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: May 1st**

### May 1st thoughts & takeways:

* The Governor's order to open restaurants and other businesses begins today. Yesterday's volume data was pretty much on par for what we saw last Thursday. Fridays are usually the highest volume day, since daily rush hour traffic combines with people traveling to locations for the weekend or other leisure activities. We'll see how this looks in the data tomorrow morning. I'll be watching the late evening (6-9pm) to see if we're getting higher volumes of people heading out to eat or whatever. 

* The Austin airport reported a [52% decrease](http://austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/images/Airport/news_releases/activity_report_year/2020/March_2020.pdf) in passenger traffic in March 2020 as compared to March 2019. KLM permanently canceled its new route of Amsterdam-Austin that was scheduled to launch this coming Monday. March 2020 was the least amount of passenger traffic for any 1-month period since February 2014.
