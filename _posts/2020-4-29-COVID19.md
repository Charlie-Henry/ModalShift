title: Measuring COVID-19
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

A post dedicated to measuring the impact ~~and recovery~~ of COVID-19 in the Austin area. 

<!--more-->

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: October 1st **

***

### October 1st thoughts & takeaways:

* This past week saw traffic volumes decrease about 7%. This is the biggest weekly decrease since March. Its not entirely clear but I assume it has to do with people staying close to home now that virtual schooling is in full swing (for the time being).

* I've added another update to the TSA checkpoint data. We set a new daily record for passenger traffic during the Labor Day weekend. The 4th of July and Memorial Day also saw a similar bump in Austin air travel.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
