A post dedicated to measuring the impact and recovery of COVID-19 in the Austin area.

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: May 20th**

### May 20th thoughts & takeways:

* Check out the analysis I did below on travel time and congestion in Austin post-COVID. While traffic volumes have decreased around 40-50%, congestion has reduced 94% and travel times have been reduced by 30%.

* Volumes have started to bounce back now that weather has returned to being hot and humid.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
