A post dedicated to measuring the impact and recovery of COVID-19 in the Austin area. 

<!--more-->

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: May 27th**

***

### May 27th thoughts & takeaways:

* I've changed some of the plots around and changed the intersections I've been looking at for the volume & speed plots. A few were locations stopped reporting data over the course of the past month so those were removed. 

* I've added a plot that compares Austin traffic vs national trends data from Apple. It sounds like the data comes from people requesting directions in Apple maps, which probably would skew from the normal amount during memorial day weekend. It appears that nationally the traffic has already recovered past the January 13th baseline Apple compares to.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
