A post dedicated to measuring the impact and recovery of COVID-19 in the Austin area.

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: May 23rd**

### May 23rd thoughts & takeaways:

* Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday's traffic volumes all were very similar. Yesterday only barely higher than the previous Friday which I thought was strange as it was the beginning of the long weekend and with all of the extra businesses that could open. That being said, it was the 2nd busiest day on Austin's roads since the beginning of the lockdown. 

* Last week I was curious what kind of traffic is actually returning to the roads over the past month of so. Is it people returning to work? People feeling cabin sick and heading outside? I pulled the data and grouped by a few analysis periods. From April 5th to May 2nd, weekend traffic was recovering the fastest, and nearly 4x as fast as the AM peak hour.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
