A post dedicated to measuring the impact and recovery of COVID-19 in the Austin area.

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: June 29th**

***

### June 29th thoughts & takeaways:

* The last two weeks have seen decreasing volumes. Last week decreased 6.3%. I guess people are seeing the increasing cases and are deciding to stay home. 

* Sunday's volume was lower than Father's day. With the 3-day weekend coming up, we'll probably see daily volumes continue to drop.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
