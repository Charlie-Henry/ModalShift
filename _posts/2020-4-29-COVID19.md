A post dedicated to measuring the impact ~~and recovery~~ of COVID-19 in the Austin area.

I will update these charts periodically with new data.

### September 15th, 2021 thoughts & takeaways:

* I've included a new chart below that will update every evening that shows the last 7 day's traffic broken down by time of day. The morning peak is still almost non-existent and nowhere near the pre-pandemic levels.

* June, July, August were all 88 to 89% of normal conditions with no discernible bump after the return to school in early August. 

* Now that students are back on campus at UT, mircomobility trips have reached a new record high.

* Airport passengers peaked back during the 4th of July Holiday. Since then, there has been a pretty steep drop off to March 2021 levels. The lack of business travel has really caused there to be a steeper drop off during the "shoulder" seasons of the late summer/early fall.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
