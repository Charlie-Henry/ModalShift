A post dedicated to measuring the impact ~~and recovery~~ of COVID-19 in the Austin area.

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: July 6th**

### July 6th thoughts & takeaways:

* Over last week, the traffic volume decreased 2.4%. 

* The 4th of July looks more like a regular Sunday and it follows what we saw on Memorial Day. Only about 1% higher than the volume seen on Memorial Day.

* Since Memorial Day wasn't particularly great for social distancing and staying at home, I'd say this isn't great news for keeping cases down. 

* I've been diving deep into that TSA data because I thought it was an interesting way to compare when cities locked down and how the virus is spreading. Here's a chart showing the relative difference in passengers through TSA checkpoints for a few airports I'm interested in:

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
