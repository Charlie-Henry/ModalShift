A post dedicated to measuring the impact ~~and recovery~~ of COVID-19 in the Austin area.

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: February 2nd, 2021**

### February 2nd, 2021 thoughts & takeaways:

* I am now showing almost an entire year of data going back to February 1st, 2020.

* There is an interesting bump in traffic in the lead up to Christmas. Boxing day was only eight thousand more vehicles more than Thanksgiving day and the second lowest daily traffic I've recorded.

* January 10th, 2021 was the highest number of traffic incidents recorded since COVID. This was due to a snow "storm" that came in that morning.

* Micromobility trips are down since the students aren't around as much from Thanksgiving-February. Also the weather sometimes doesn't cooperate.  

* January 3rd, 2021 set a new daily record since COVID at the AUS TSA checkpoint. The extra-long weekend caused by New Year's Day falling on a Friday really compressed traveler's schedules. December 8th, 2020 was the least busy day at the airport since Independence Day caused by the lull in leisure and business travel between Thanksgiving and the Holidays.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
