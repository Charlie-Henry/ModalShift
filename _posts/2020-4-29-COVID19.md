A post dedicated to measuring the impact ~~and recovery~~ of COVID-19 in the Austin area.

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: July 15th**

### July 15th thoughts & takeaways:

* I'd like to shout out some fantastic modeling work done by Will Barbour and Vanderbilt. [They created a "rebound calculator"] (https://lab-work.github.io/therebound/) that estimates travel time impacts based on mode changes due to COVID-19. 
* Here's a plot I created using the tool they included in their post. The big takeaway being that congestion in cities with more transit riders will be impacted much more than car-dependent cities like Austin. I compare a scenario where we kept the same mode split as we did in 2018 versus one where everyone drove alone.

* My initial thinking was have been that we would actually see improved traffic congestion in a post-COVID world. It's possible that is what we'll see in a car-dependent city like Austin but that won't be the same story in San Francisco or New York. It's also possible that we could see higher numbers of remote workers, especially if congestion got really much worse. I also didn't look at job losses, which would have a similar impact as working remotely. 

* Working remotely also generates trips, generally shorter, home-based trips and these aren't taken into account in more commute-centered modeling like this.

* One of the biggest riders of transit in Austin are school children. I wonder what the impact on school bus ridership will be.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
