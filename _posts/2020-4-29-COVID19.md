title: Measuring COVID-19
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

A post dedicated to measuring the impact ~~and recovery~~ of COVID-19 in the Austin area. 

<!--more-->

I will update these charts periodically with new data.

### May 4th, 2021 thoughts & takeaways:

* Traffic volumes were about 82% of the pre-COVID numbers during April, which is only about a 1-2% increase since March. The big rebound in traffic volumes that was potentially expected after the removal of COVID restrictions in March and the vaccine distribution hasn't happened. Yet?

* Ignoring the potential outliers back on October 4th and 5th, a new daily post-COVID record was set for traffic volumes on April 25th where volumes were 90.0% of normal conditions. 

* Bird deployed some a new scooter model to Austin streets over the past month. A new operator "LINK" has deployed 500 scooters. April kept pace with the increase during Spring Break and averaged about 70,000 trips a week.

* Passengers through the Austin Airport TSA checkpoint have rebounded to about 60% of pre-COVID numbers.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
