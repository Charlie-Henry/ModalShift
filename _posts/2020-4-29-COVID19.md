A post dedicated to measuring the impact ~~and recovery~~ of COVID-19 in the Austin area.

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: December 14th**

### December 14th thoughts & takeaways:

*  Since I last updated this post, we've had the Thanksgiving holiday. Thanksgiving has a reputation of a big traffic day. However, Thanksgiving day was the lowest traffic volume day since April. Since October the weekly moving average is pretty stable at about 70% of pre-pandemic levels.

* Air travel at the Austin airport did just barely break a new daily (pandemic) record of 11,000 passengers through TSA turnstiles on November 8th. The day before Thanksgiving is traditionally the busiest air travel day of the year, Austin had 10,900 passengers. After the initial slowdown, Austin's share of US passengers has remained stable at about 1% since June which is a good sign for the future. 

* Revel mopeds have left Austin. Daily micromobility trips have dropped back down to about 4,500. This probably has more to do with the colder weather, ending of the semester at UT, and the Thanksgiving holiday.

### Austin travel times post-COVID

Comparing to this time last year, these Austin corridors have seen a 30% reduction in travel time. This works out to being a **94% reduction in congestion** for only 40-50% decrease in volume. [For details, check out this full post on it here.](http://modalshift.co/COVID19/congestion/) Working with this bluetooth data from the publicly available open data portal was a lot of work so give it some love.
