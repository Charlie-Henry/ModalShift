A post dedicated to measuring the impact and recovery of COVID-19 in the Austin area.

I will update these charts periodically with new data. **Last update: May 3rd**

### May 3rd thoughts & takeways:

* Following the lifting the stay-at-home order for Texas, Friday's traffic volume was 8% higher than the previous Friday. The same trend remains true for Saturday's volumes. This was not significantly different than the trend we've been seeing over the past two weeks.

* Some have wondered if we'll see a "U-shaped" or "V-shaped" recovery from the shutdown. The linear trend following the end of the stay-at-home order bodes well for a Nike swoosh-shaped recovery. If you forecast out this trend line, traffic volumes would recover to the volumes we saw in February around September 1st.
