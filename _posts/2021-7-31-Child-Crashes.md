# Race and Ethnicity:

![config.yml]({{site.baseurl}}/visualizations/Austin-Child-Crashes/By%20population.png) 

Black children are three times more likely to be killed or seriously injured in a car crash than white children in Austin. Hispanic children are about twice as likely as white children. 

# Time of Day:

![config.yml]({{site.baseurl}}/visualizations/Austin-Child-Crashes/Hour.png) 

The peak time of day for serious or fatal crashes is 2PM. This coincides with many elementary school release times here in Texas. The commute to school (6-8AM) is not as noticeable. 

# Mode:

![config.yml]({{site.baseurl}}/visualizations/Austin-Child-Crashes/mode.png) 

Children are much more likely to be seriously injured or killed in pedestrian crashes. 30% of of all child serious/fatal crashes are pedestrian or bicyclist.

A high concentration serious/fatal child crashes are in East Austin, St. John, Onion Creek, and Rundberg neighborhoods. Contrast that with few crashes in Central and West Austin.

# The Data

Austin's crash data is maintained by TxDOT and the City of Austin. See their Vision Zero Data viewer [here](https://visionzero.austin.gov/viewer/)

I've defined "child" as someone under the age of 16. For demographic data, I used the [Texas Demographic Center's Population Estimates for Travis County.](https://demographics.texas.gov/Data/TPEPP/Estimates/)
