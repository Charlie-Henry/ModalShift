Our dockless automobiles provide some of the longest trip lengths in the region. Although, one trip will always contain multiple modes, even it is walking through a parking lot. Reducing vehicle trips will require *access* to public transportation. Many are hoping that new mobility methods will solve [the last mile problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile_(transportation))

When you look at these numbers it is important to keep the scale in mind. I am examining an urban area in a largely suburban city.  
When only 7% of Austinites can replace their car, we must make investments in public transportation.
